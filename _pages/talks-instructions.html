                    <p>We’re really looking forward to seeing your talk at this month’s <strong>Dot Net Liverpool meetup</strong> event! This page explains how the evening will run, what we’ll need from you, and how to make sure everything goes smoothly on the night.</p>

                    <div class="mb-40"></div>

                    <h4>🎤 Arrival & Setup</h4>
                    <p>Please arrive <strong>15–20 minutes before the event starts</strong>. This gives us time to test your laptop, slides, or any demos before the talks begin.</p>
                    <p>If you have any special setup requirements (e.g., sound output, browser version, or device quirks), please let us know in advance so we can accommodate you.</p>

                    <div class="mb-40"></div>

                    <h4>💻 AV & Screen Sharing Setup</h4>
                    <p>You can either use your own laptop, or send your slides to us beforehand and we can present them for you.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>If using your own laptop:</strong> We’ll have an HDMI connection available (1080p). Please bring any adapters you might need (USB-C, DisplayPort, etc.).</li>
                        <li><strong>If you’d like us to present your slides:</strong> Please send them at least <strong>24 hours before the event</strong> so we can merge them into our master deck.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For screen sharing and live demos, we use <a href="https://vdo.ninja/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VDO.Ninja</a>. You can stream your screen by joining with the tag <strong>dotnetliverpool123</strong>, which connects directly to our livestream software.</p>

                    <h4>🗣️ Talk Length & Format</h4>
                    <p>As a standard, we recommend presentations run between <strong>45 minutes</strong> and <strong>1 hour 40 minutes</strong>. If your session is likely on the longer side, we suggest including a short break midway to keep everyone refreshed.</p>
                    <p>For shorter talks, we can often arrange another speaker to fill the second half of the evening — just let us know in advance so we can plan accordingly.</p>
                    <p>There’s no fixed format — slides, live demos, storytelling, or interactive coding sessions are all welcome. The main aim is to share something valuable, spark discussion, and inspire the community.</p>
                    <div class="mb-40"></div>

                    <h4>📽️ Recording & Livestream Consent</h4>
                    <p>We often livestream and record our talks for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DotNetLiverpool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dot Net Liverpool YouTube channel</a>. By presenting, you’re giving us permission to include your talk in the livestream and future videos.</p>
                    <p>If you’d prefer <strong>not to be recorded or streamed</strong>, please email or message us before the event so we can make alternative arrangements (e.g., pausing the stream during your slot).</p>

                    <h4>📑 Slide Presentations</h4>
                    <p>If your talk only involves slides (no live demo), we may merge your slides into a shared presentation deck to avoid switching laptops between speakers — this keeps transitions smooth and the event flowing.</p>
                    <p>Please send slides in <strong>PowerPoint (.pptx)</strong> or <strong>PDF format</strong> to <a href="mailto:contact@dotnetliverpool.org.uk">contact@dotnetliverpool.org.uk</a> at least a day before the event if you'd like us to host them.</p>

                    <h4>💬 Questions or Help</h4>
                    <p>If you have any questions, you can post them in the <strong>#general</strong> channel on our <a href="https://discord.gg/XN8M3gKzYj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server</a>. We’ll be keeping an eye there in the lead-up to the event and on the day itself.</p>
